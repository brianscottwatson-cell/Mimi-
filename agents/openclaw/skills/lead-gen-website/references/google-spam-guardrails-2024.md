Violating these policies can result in manual actions, ranking penalties, or complete deindexing.

---

## Doorway Pages — PROHIBITED
**Definition:** Pages created primarily to rank for specific search queries and funnel visitors to a single destination.

**Red flags to avoid:**
- Multiple pages targeting different cities with only the city name swapped
- Thin pages that exist solely to capture a keyword and redirect to a main page
- Pages with near-identical content differing only in location names

**How to stay compliant:**
- Each page must have unique, substantial content (500+ words)
- Include city-specific information (landmarks, neighborhoods, local context)
- Each page should be valuable to a visitor who lands directly on it
- If a page wouldn't exist without SEO, it probably shouldn't exist

## Scaled Content Abuse — PROHIBITED
**Definition:** Generating large amounts of content primarily to manipulate rankings, regardless of method (AI, templates, scraping).

**Red flags to avoid:**
- Mass-generating service pages with templated content and only swapping keywords
- Using AI to generate dozens of thin blog posts for keyword coverage
- Content that doesn't add value beyond what already exists in search results

**How to stay compliant:**
- Every piece of content must provide genuine value to the reader
- AI-generated content is fine IF reviewed, edited, and enriched with expertise
- Quality over quantity — 10 excellent pages beat 50 thin ones
- Each page should answer a specific user question with depth

## Fake Reviews / Testimonials — PROHIBITED
**Red flags to avoid:**
- Fabricated customer names and reviews
- Paying for fake reviews on Google Business Profile
- Copying reviews from competitors

**How to stay compliant:**
- Only use real testimonials with permission
- Link to verified review platforms (Google, Trustpilot)
- If no reviews yet, use trust signals instead (certifications, experience, guarantees)

## Fake Business Information — PROHIBITED
**Red flags to avoid:**
- Listing a P.O. box or virtual office as a physical address
- Using a fake local phone number (VoIP routed elsewhere)
- Claiming to serve areas you don't actually cover

**How to stay compliant:**
- Use real business address (or clearly state "service area" business if no storefront)
- Real local phone number
- Only list service areas you genuinely cover

## Leadgen / Mise en Relation — DISCLOSURE REQUIRED
If the website connects visitors with third-party service providers:

- **Clearly disclose** on all key pages that you are an intermediary
- State who the actual service providers are (or that they are vetted partners)
- Don't present as the direct service provider if you're not
- Include disclosure in footer, about page, and contact form

## Link Spam — PROHIBITED
**Red flags to avoid:**
- Buying backlinks from link farms or directories
- Excessive link exchanges
- Spammy guest posts on irrelevant sites

**How to stay compliant:**
- Earn links through quality content and local partnerships
- Local citations should be on legitimate directories only
- Guest posting only on relevant, quality sites with editorial standards

## Pre-Launch Checklist

Before publishing any lead-gen site, verify:

- [ ] All reviews/testimonials are real and authorized
- [ ] Business information is accurate and verifiable
- [ ] If leadgen/intermediary: disclosure is clear on all key pages
- [ ] No purchased or spammy backlinks planned
- [ ] Content would be valuable even without SEO motivation
