## 30-Day Launch Plan

### Week 1: Foundation
- Day 1-2: Complete GBP profile 100%
- Day 3-4: Upload 5+ high-quality photos (storefront, team, work examples)
- Day 5-7: Write first Google Post (introduction/welcome)

- Day 8-10: Add 5 more photos (before/after work, equipment, vehicles)
- Day 11-12: Write second Google Post (featured service)
- Day 13-14: Seed 5 Q&A entries

### Week 3: Reviews
- Day 15-17: Ask 3-5 past customers for reviews (personal message, not mass email)
- Day 18-19: Respond to any reviews received (even positive ones)
- Day 20-21: Write third Google Post (seasonal tip or offer)

### Week 4: Citations

- Day 25-26: Verify NAP consistency across all listings
- Day 27-28: Upload 3 more photos
- Day 29-30: Review metrics, plan month 2

## Photo Strategy
- **Minimum**: 10 photos at launch, add 2-3 per week ongoing
- **Types**: Storefront/van, team, work in progress, completed work, equipment
- **Quality**: Well-lit, in focus, no stock photos
- **Geotagging**: Photos taken on-site include GPS data naturally

## NAP Citations (Quality First)
Submit to these directories (France-focused):
1. Pages Jaunes (pagesjaunes.fr)
2. Yelp France
3. Societe.com
4. Kompass
5. Local city directory (mairie website)
6. Industry-specific directories (e.g., Houzz for renovation)
7. Facebook Business page
8. Apple Maps Connect
9. Bing Places

**Rules:**
- NAP must be IDENTICAL everywhere (same format, same abbreviations)
- Quality over quantity — 10 real directories > 50 spam directories
- No paid "citation building" services (often link farms)

## Review Strategy
- Ask happy customers personally (not mass requests)
- Timing: within 48h of completed service
- Make it easy: send direct Google review link
- Respond to ALL reviews within 24h
- Never offer incentives for reviews (Google policy violation)
- Handle negative reviews professionally: acknowledge, apologize, offer resolution offline

## Ongoing Maintenance
- Weekly: Check for new Q&A, respond to reviews
- Bi-weekly: New Google Post
- Monthly: 3-5 new photos, verify hours/info accuracy
- Quarterly: Review categories, update services/pricing
