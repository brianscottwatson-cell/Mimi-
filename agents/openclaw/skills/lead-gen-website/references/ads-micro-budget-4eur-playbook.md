# Micro-Budget Google Ads Playbook (4EUR/day)

## Philosophy
With 4EUR/day (~120EUR/month), every click must count. Zero waste tolerance.

## Campaign Structure — One Ultra-Tight Campaign

### Campaign Settings
- **Type**: Search only (no Display, no Performance Max)
- **Budget**: 4EUR/day
- **Bidding**: Maximize clicks (switch to Maximize conversions after 30+ conversions)
- **Network**: Search only (uncheck Search Partners and Display)
- **Location**: Target radius 15-30km from business (adjust based on service area)
- **Schedule**: Business hours only (e.g., Mon-Fri 7h-19h, Sat 8h-14h)
- **Language**: French

### Ad Group — One, Maximum Two
- 3-5 exact match keywords (highest intent)
- 2-3 phrase match keywords (controlled expansion)
- Example for a plumber in Metz:
  - `[plombier metz]`
  - `[depannage plomberie metz]`
  - `[plombier urgence metz]`
  - `"plombier metz pas cher"`
  - `"fuite eau metz"`

### Negative Keywords (Critical)
Add immediately to prevent waste:
- Competitor brand names
- "emploi", "recrutement", "salaire", "formation"
- "gratuit", "DIY", "comment faire"
- "avis", "forum" (low intent)
- Geographic areas you don't serve
- Review and add negatives weekly from Search Terms report

### Ad Copy
- **Headline 1**: Primary keyword + location ("Plombier a Metz")
- **Headline 2**: Value proposition ("Devis Gratuit en 2h")
- **Headline 3**: CTA ("Appelez Maintenant")
- **Description**: Service details + trust signals + CTA
- **Extensions**: Call extension, location, sitelinks (services, tarifs, contact)

## Landing Page — Dedicated
Do NOT send traffic to homepage. Create a dedicated landing page:
- Hero matches ad copy exactly (message match)
- One clear CTA (phone call preferred)
- Trust signals above the fold
- Fast loading (< 3 seconds)
- Mobile-optimized (most searches are mobile)
- UTM tracking on form

## Tracking Setup
- Google Ads conversion tracking on form submit
- Phone call tracking (Google forwarding number or third-party)
- Link Google Ads to Google Analytics
- Review Search Terms report weekly

## Weekly Optimization Routine (15 minutes)
1. Check Search Terms report → add negatives
2. Review keyword performance → pause keywords with high cost / no conversions
3. Check ad schedule → shift budget to best-performing hours
4. Monitor Quality Score → improve if below 7
5. After 30 days: evaluate CPA, adjust bids/budget

## Red Lines — Never Do
- Don't enable Display Network (wastes budget on irrelevant placements)
- Don't use broad match keywords (uncontrollable spend)
- Don't run 24/7 (waste on off-hours clicks)
- Don't skip negative keywords (biggest budget killer)
- Don't send traffic to homepage (poor message match = low conversion)

## Expected Performance (4EUR/day)
- CPC: 1-3EUR (local services, French market)
- Clicks/day: 1-4
- Clicks/month: 40-120
- Conversion rate (good landing page): 10-20%
- Leads/month: 4-24
- Target CPA: under 10EUR/lead
