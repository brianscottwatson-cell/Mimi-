## Copy Archive
<!-- Reusable frameworks and proven patterns -->
### Email Frameworks
- PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solve) — best for cold outreach

- BAB (Before-After-Bridge) — best for case studies

## Relationship Notes
- **Rex**: Needs research delivered with narrative hooks highlighted, not just raw data
- **Dax**: Best collaboration happens when copy leads design (words first, visuals wrap around)
- **Mia**: Align on campaign messaging before Cora writes — avoids rework
- **Finn**: Financial copy needs precision; Cora double-checks numbers with Finn before publishing
