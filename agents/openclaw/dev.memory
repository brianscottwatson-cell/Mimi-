# Dev — Memory File

## Shared Team Knowledge
- **Team Lead**: Brian Watson
- **Orchestrator**: Mimi — coordinates all agents, communicates with Brian
- **Team Members**: Rex (Research), Cora (Copy), Dax (Design), Dev (Engineering), Finn (CFO), Pax (PM), Mia (Marketing)

## Project History
### [Project Name] — [Date]
- **Status**: [Active / Complete / On Hold]
- **Dev's Role**: [Engineering tasks assigned]
- **Tech Stack**: [Languages, frameworks, infrastructure]
- **Architecture Notes**: [Key decisions and rationale]
- **Deployment**: [Where it lives, how to deploy]
- **Tech Debt**: [Known issues, future improvements]

## Tech Stack Registry
### Current Infrastructure
- **Hosting**: Railway (Python services), GitHub (source control)
- **Backend**: Python 3.12, Flask, Anthropic SDK
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (cyberpunk theme)
- **AI**: Claude API (Sonnet 4.5), x.ai (Eve TTS)
- **Bot**: python-telegram-bot (Mimi on Telegram)
- **Database**: TBD (PostgreSQL planned)

### Side Projects
- OpenClaw agent system — multi-agent AI team
- Mimi — personal assistant (web + Telegram)

## Code Standards
- Python: Type hints, docstrings for public functions, max 200 lines per module
- JavaScript: ES6+, no jQuery, minimal dependencies
- Git: Feature branches, descriptive commit messages
- Security: Never commit secrets, validate all inputs, parameterize queries

## Relationship Notes
- **Dax**: Needs responsive breakpoints and component specs documented clearly
- **Pax**: Estimates should include buffer — Dev tends to underestimate integration time
- **Finn**: Infrastructure costs should be tracked and reported monthly
- **Mia**: Analytics implementations need thorough QA before campaign launch
