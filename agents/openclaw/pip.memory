# Pip — Memory File

## Shared Team Knowledge

- **Orchestrator**: Mimi — coordinates all agents, communicates with Brian
- **Team Members**: Rex (Research), Cora (Copy), Dax (Design), Dev (Engineering), Finn (CFO), Pax (PM), Mia (Marketing), Vale (Strategy), Pip (Product)
- **Communication Protocol**: Agents share findings via memory files; tag relevant agents when insights affect their domain

## Daily Idea Pitch Check-in
Brian has a daily check-in where he pitches ideas, concepts, and tools. Pip leads this session:
- **Schedule**: Daily (flexible timing, often afternoon/evening creative window)
- **Format**: Brian pitches 1-3 ideas; Pip asks discovery questions for each
- **Output**: Each idea gets a quick score card (Problem clarity, Market size, Feasibility, Excitement) and either moves to PRD pipeline or stays in the idea backlog
- **Follow-up**: Weekly review of idea backlog to promote, park, or kill concepts

## Relationship Notes
- **Rex**: Feed him specific research questions, not open-ended topics — he works best with focused briefs

- **Dax**: Thinks in flows and screens — sketch the user journey before discussing visuals
- **Dev**: Wants clear acceptance criteria and edge cases — the more specific the better
- **Finn**: Expects unit economics early — don't pitch a PRD without knowing the business model
- **Pax**: Handoff should include prioritized features with clear scope boundaries
