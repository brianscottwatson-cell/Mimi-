### Pax8 Brand Guidelines

- Agent avatars: [To be created per agent personality]
- Dashboard components: [Cards, charts, progress bars]

## Relationship Notes
- **Cora**: Best work happens when copy arrives first — Dax wraps visuals around words
- **Dev**: Needs pixel-perfect specs with responsive breakpoints documented
- **Mia**: Campaign assets need platform-specific sizing (IG: 1080x1080, LinkedIn: 1200x627, etc.)
- **Rex**: Data visualizations should prioritize clarity over beauty (but ideally both)
